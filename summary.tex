The use of battery-free systems is a revolutionary frontier for the Internet of Things; in fact, it allows network nodes to be unconstrained by the use of batteries.\\
To achieve this, battery-free systems use ambient energy to charge a capacitor and use it as a power source. Because of the unpredictability of environmental energy sources, the node is often subject to power failure.
Communication then becomes intermittent and data loss particularly frequent.\\
To solve this problem, we implemented a tiny communication stack that implements non-volatile memory management for data storage and the TRAP protocol for energy awareness between nodes.
